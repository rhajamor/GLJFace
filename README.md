GLJFace
=======
The JFace Viewer derived components are heavy weight components, an when dealing with a large amount of data we need to get components which don't consume system memory and processor time, thus the need to have a hardware accelerated components.
GLJface provides an openGL based implementation of the JFace MVC components.
<br/>The libraries used are : 
<ol>
<li><a href=http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/>JOGL</a></li>
<li><a href=http://lwjgl.org/>LWJGL</a></li>
</ol>

Goal
====
Dedicate the system memory and processor time to data porcessing not to the graphical components handling.

Implemented components 
======================
These components are hightly customizable.
<ol>
<li>GLTableViewer</li>
<li>GLTreeViewer</li>
</ol>


Future Planning
